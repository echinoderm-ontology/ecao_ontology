The cardiac sphincter has started forming, separating the future esophagus from the future stomach. The triradiate spicules have also continued elongating, thereby forming by now, towards the animal pole, the right and left dorsoventral connecting rods, towards the apex, the body rods, and along the vegetal, oral ectoderm the left and right ventral transverse rods. Moreover, some non-skeletogenic mesenchyme cells (or NSM cells, secondary mesenchyme cells or SMC) have started becoming pigmented and inserted into the aboral ectoderm. These cells represent part of the future immune system of the larvae along with other blastocoelar cells that are present in the blastocoel around the gut. In the vicinity of the future esophagus, other non-skeletogenic mesoderm descendant cells along with some endoderm cells have further arranged to form a single unpaired coelomic pouch. At the animal pole, the apical pole domain has also started to flatten making the embryo look like a square when viewed from the oral side, and it still arbors a tuft a long and immotile cilia. Finally, within the apical pole domain, but not yet in the ciliary band, molecular labeling surveys also start by this stage to reveal the presence of differentiating neuronal cells. " []

The cardiac sphincter is now fully formed in between the esophagus and the stomach, and the pyloric sphincter in between the stomach and the intestine and the anal sphincter at the level of the anus have also started forming. Around the esophagus, the coelomic pouch has further developed into two bilobed sacs (or pouches), one on each side of the digestive tract. Finally, within the apical pole domain, as well as within the ciliary band, differentiated neurons with their extended axons can also now be distinguished by immunostaining. In parallel, the apical tuft of long and immotile cilia remains discernable at the tip of the oral hood, while in parallel the ciliary band has further started growing a concentrated number of intermediate size motile cilia, which will be used by the larva to swim directionally.

The first morphological indicator of a left-right asymmetry becomes apparent at that stage, the left coelomic pouch being slightly more elongated than the right one. Furthermore, a thin protrusion of non-skeletogenic mesenchyme cells can be seen extending from the left coelomic pouch to the anterior ectoderm. This is the primary pore canal, which opens to the exterior environment by the hydropore. The larva further now possesses, all around the esophagus, a network of contractile muscles allowing it to swallow and feed.

def: "The 8-arm pluteus larva is mainly characterized morphologically by the presence on the ventral side of the larva of eight arms and by the development within the larva, on the left side of the stomach, of the adult rudiment. This stage is relatively long. It includes distinct changes occurring to the larva as well as within the larva, although the larva consistently exhibits 8 arms. In addition, it should be highlighted that the sequence of events taking place at the level of the larva compared to that occurring on the left side of the stomach to form the rudiment are heterochronic, meaning that differences are observed among individuals in the relative timing of these events. From the larval point of view, at that stage, on the anterior side, the dorsal arch has extended out of the oral hood, thereby forming two additional arms above the mouth, i.e. the preoral arms. In parallel, across the apex, the epaulettes have continued developing, thereby generating four large structures rich in cilia and perpendicular to the ventro-dorsal axis. At the tip of the apex, the suture of the body rods has also eventually ruptured, considerably enlarging the larval apex and reducing the angle between the postoral and posterodorsal arms. In parallel, inside the larva, the left coelomic pouch has also by now been partitioned into three parts: the axocoel (upper part, close to the esophagus), the hydrocoel (middle part) and the somatocoel (lower part, next to the stomach). Likewise, on the opposite side, the right coelomic pouch has also been partitioned into a right axohydrocoel and a right somatocoel, although the right axohydrocoel remains in a rudimentary state compared to its left counterparts. In addition, at the basis of the posterodorsal arm on the left side, a small portion of the ectoderm has thickened, invaginated, and came into contact with the left hydocoel. This structure is called the vestibule and together with the left hydrocoel and the left stomatocoel they have further subsequently fused to form the adult rudiment. The formation of the rudiment has overall taken some time, giving rise first to a pentaradial disc and then to a pentaradial complex structure harboring podia (i.e. tube feet) and spines. In parallel, on the right size of the larva, a variable number of pedicellariae (one to four) and endoskeletal elements (i.e. the five genital plates) have further formed, which will also later contribute to the composition of the adult body."

At the level of the larva, in parallel, the anterior and posterior pairs of epaulettes have also considerably increased in size by now and even fused dorsally to the hydropore and to the anus respectively, thereby leaving exempt of cilia two lateral fields in between them. At the center of the left lateral field, the vestibular roof has also by now ruptured and this opening has created the vestibular pore, through which some primary podia of the rudiment protrude outside the larva and scrutinize the substrate looking for the adequate cues to begin metamorphosis. At that stage, the larva is thus exhibiting a typical substrate-test behavior, going to the sea bottom and scrutinizing the substrate. This behavior is characteristic of a larva named competent to metamorphosis, which it will accomplish providing that it is adequately stimulated by environmental factors. " []

def: "The metamorphic larva stage consists essentially of the evagination of the echinoid rudiment. It is characterized by the execution of conspicuous and relatively abrupt physical changes that take place quite quickly, in about one hour, and during which the planktonic larva is transformed into a benthic juvenile. At that stage, the larva is settled on the substrate and is firmly attached to it by the primary podia of the rudiment. The ectodermal epithelium of its arms has started to collapse, making the spicules supporting the larval arms piercing through the epidermis. The larval mouth and anus have further closed, while in parallel, within the larva, the rudiment spines have lifted up thereby distending the vestibular wall and wide opening the vestibular pore. Following these movements, the rudiment has farther down accomplished and finalized its complete eversion, encapsulating the digestive tract and reaching the right side of the larval body. During this process, the genital plates and the associated pedicellariae and immature spines present on the right side of the larva have further completed the production of the aboral part of the adult body. At the end of metamorphosis, hence at the end of the metamorphic larva stage, the individual has thus become benthic, it is settled in the substrate, and it looks like an adult pentaradial sea urchin although it is smaller in size, deprived of a functional digestive system and sexually immature.

On its aboral side, it still exhibits some remaining larval rods and tissues, although these will soon disappear. In addition, the plates forming its endoskeleton are still rather light and porous making it looking relatively clear, although it bears lots of red-pigmented cells. However, the postlarva is still deprived of a mouth and an anus, hence of a functional digestive tract. The early juvenile is thus endotrophic, meaning that its growth and development solely relies on energy derived from internal sources. Furthermore, the early juvenile is sexually immature." []

The late juvenile is exotrophic, meaning that its growth and development rely on energy derived from external sources. In addition, the primary podia have started to regress by that stage and will eventually disappear, while secondary podia have emerged and are functional, allowing the juvenile to move.

property_value: editor_note "This branch of the ontology deals with causal relations between entities. It is divided into two branches: causal relations between occurrents/processes, and causal relations between material entities. We take an 'activity flow-centric approach', with the former as primary, and define causal relations between material entities in terms of causal relations between occurrents.\n\nTo define causal relations in an activity-flow type network, we make use of 3 primitives:\n\n * Temporal: how do the intervals of the two occurrents relate? \n * Is the causal relation regulatory?\n * Is the influence positive or negative\n\nThe first of these can be formalized in terms of the Allen Interval Algebra. Informally, the 3 bins we care about are 'direct', 'indirect' or overlapping. Note that all causal relations should be classified under a RO temporal relation (see the branch under 'temporally related to'). Note that all causal relations are temporal, but not all temporal relations are causal. Two occurrents can be related in time without being causally connected. We take causal influence to be primitive, elucidated as being such that has the upstream changed, some qualities of the donwstream would necessarily be modified.\n\nFor the second, we consider a relationship to be regulatory if the system in which the activities occur is capable of altering the relationship to achieve some objective. This could include changing the rate of production of a molecule.\n\nFor the third, we consider the effect of the upstream process on the output(s) of the downstream process. If the level of output is increased, or the rate of production of the output is increased, then the direction is increased. Direction can be positive, negative or neutral or capable of either direction. Two positives in succession yield a positive, two negatives in succession yield a positive, otherwise the default assumption is that the net effect is canceled and the influence is neutral.\n\nEach of these 3 primitives can be composed to yield a cross-product of different relation types." xsd:string

property_value: editor_note "An example is: translation preceded_by transcription; aging preceded_by development (not however death preceded_by aging). Where derives_from links classes of continuants, preceded_by links classes of processes. Clearly, however, these two relations are not independent of each other. Thus if cells of type C1 derive_from cells of type C, then any cell division involving an instance of C1 in a given lineage is preceded_by cellular processes involving an instance of C.    The assertion P preceded_by P1 tells us something about Ps in general: that is, it tells us something about what happened earlier, given what we know about what happened later. Thus it does not provide information pointing in the opposite direction, concerning instances of P1 in general; that is, that each is such as to be succeeded by some instance of P. Note that an assertion to the effect that P preceded_by P1 is rather weak; it tells us little about the relations between the underlying instances in virtue of which the preceded_by relation obtains. Typically we will be interested in stronger relations, for example in the relation immediately_preceded_by, or in relations which combine preceded_by with a condition to the effect that the corresponding instances of P and P1 share participants, or that their participants are connected by relations of derivation, or (as a first step along the road to a treatment of causality) that the one process in some way affects (for example, initiates or regulates) the other." xsd:string

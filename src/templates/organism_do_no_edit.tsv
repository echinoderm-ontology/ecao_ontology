ECAO:0000190	16-cell stage		cleavage period				An embryo that is composed of 16 cells and is surrounded by a fertilization envelope.  Note for euechinoid indirect developers: although the fourth cleavage occurred simultaneously in all cells, the pattern of cell division differed in the animal and vegetal blastomeres. In the animal hemisphere the four cells divided meridionally, producing eight blastomeres of equal volume arrayed in a single tier. These cells are called the mesomeres. In the vegetal hemisphere, the four cells underwent an unequal, equatorial cleavage, producing a tier of four large cells, the macromeres, and a tier of four small cells, the micromeres, located at the vegetal pole. At the 16-cell stage, the embryo is hence composed of three groups of cells with distinct sizes. In most sea urchin species,this is the first morphological indication of the animal-vegetal axis. 	16c													Formery et al., (in prep)  Okazaki, K. (1975). Normal Development to Metamorphosis.

Note for euechinoid indirect developers: In most sea urchin species, the fifth cleavage signed the end of cell division synchrony, with the mesomeres and macromeres dividing prior to the micromeres with a significant time difference. In the animal hemisphere, the mesomeres underwent an equal and equatorial cleavage, giving rise to two animal cell tiers, each composed of eight blastomeres of equal size: the an1 tier located at the animal pole and the an2 tier located below an1. In parallel, the macromeres divided meridionally, forming a ring of eight cells of equal volume located below the an2 tier. At that stage, the micromeres have not yet divided and are still at a number of four cells.	28c													Formery et al., (in prep)  Okazaki, K. (1975). Normal Development to Metamorphosis.

Note for euechinoid indirect developers: In the animal hemisphere, cells of the an1 and an2 tiers underwent an additional meridional division, producing tiers composed of 16 cells. The macromeres divided equatorially and equally, generating two vegetal cell tiers, each composed of 8 cells of equal volume, namely the veg1 tier (located below an2) and the veg2 tier (located below veg1 and above the large micromeres).

Following the initial invagination of the vegetal plate, the archenteron has slightly been extended, within the blastocoel, by the subsequent invagination of additional non-skeletogenic mesoderm cells and of some endoderm cells. In parallel, the skeletogenic mesenchyme cells (or SM cells, primary mesenchyme cells or PMC) have by now started migrating along the blastocoel wall, towards the animal pole, thereby creating two lateral chains (one left and one right), while around the developing archenteron, they have gathered into two ventrolateral clusters separated by an oral (or ventral) and an aboral (or dorsal) chain defined by the remaining skeletogenic mesenchyme cells. Within the oral and aboral skeletogenic mesenchyme chains, the cells have further started to fuse to form syncytial filopodial cables within which skeletal calcification will subsequently take place. At the animal pole, the animal neuroectoderm territory is still marked by an enlarged epithelium bearing long and immotile cilia.  	eG, EG													Formery et al., (in prep)  Kominami, T. and Takata, H.

A second phase of archenteron elongation has taken place by invagination of additional cells into the blastocoel, by cell division or by convergent-extension movements depending on the sea urchin species. Non-skeletogenic mesoderm cells that are present at the tip of the archenteron have further started ingressing into the blastocoel, generating the non-skeletogenic mesenchyme cells (or NSM cells, secondary mesenchyme cells or SMC). The oral ectoderm has also started to flatten and to become thicker, providing the first morphological indicator of the oral-aboral (or ventro-dorsal) axis of the embryo. As a consequence the oral chain formed by a portion of the skeletogenic mesenchyme cells has also flattened. Finally, skeletal calcification has further begun within the skeletogenic mesenchyme ventrolateral clusters, marked by the presence of the first calcified structures, which appear as small dots at that stage. At the animal pole, the animal neuroectoderm territory is still marked by an enlarged epithelium bearing long and immotile cilia.

The third and last extension phase of the archenteron has been ensured by pulling forces exerted by non-skeletogenic mesoderm cells that are still present at the tip of the archenteron. These cells have produced filopodia that extended towards the animal pole, attached the wall, and then shortened, thereby pulling up the archenteron. In some sea urchin species, this pulling force is already orienting the tip of the archenteron towards the oral ectoderm, where the future mouth of the larvae will form. In parallel, in the blastocoel, additional non-skeletogenic mesoderm cells continued ingressing from the tip of the archenteron and the skeletal calcified structures present in the skeletogenic mesenchyme ventrolateral clusters have further grown, forming now the primary triradiate skeletal rudiments (or spicules). At the animal pole, the animal neuroectoderm territory is still marked by an enlarged epithelium bearing long and immotile cilia.

ECAO:0000430	prism stage		organogenesis period				The embryo is mainly characterized morphologically by a typical triangular shape, the beginning of the tripatition of the digestive tract and the presence of pigmented cells. The oral (or ventral) ectoderm has by now even more flattened, making an almost perfect right angle with the blastoporal side of the embryo. By contrast, on the opposite side, the aboral (or dorsal) ectoderm has round up and slightly elongated, thereby forming the primitive apex of the future larvae. These changes have conferred the embryo a typical and easy recognizable triangular shape. In the oral ectoderm, a small depression has further appeared, called the stomodeum, which will later fuse with the tip of the archenteron to form the mouth. In the blastocoel, the digestive tract has also by now bended toward the stomodeum and started to become tripartite. The cardiac sphincter has started forming, separating the future esophagus from the future stomach. The triradiate spicules have also continued elongating, thereby forming by now, towards the animal pole, the right and left dorsoventral connecting rods, towards the apex, the body rods, and along the vegetal, oral ectoderm the left and right ventral transverse rods. Moreover, some non-skeletogenic mesenchyme cells (or NSM cells, secondary mesenchyme cells or SMC) have started becoming pigmented and inserted into the aboral ectoderm. These cells represent part of the future immune system of the larvae along with other blastocoelar cells that are present in the blastocoel around the gut. In the vicinity of the future esophagus, other non-skeletogenic mesoderm descendant cells along with some endoderm cells have further arranged to form a single unpaired coelomic pouch. At the animal pole, the apical pole domain has also started to flatten making the embryo look like a square when viewed from the oral side, and it still arbors a tuft a long and immotile cilia. Finally, within the apical pole domain, but not yet in the ciliary band, molecular labeling surveys also start by this stage to reveal the presence of differentiating neuronal cells.

The skeleton has indeed continued extending, expending the dorsoventral connecting rods, the body rods, and the ventral transverse rods as well as developing the anterolateral rods and the postoral rods. Within the larva, the tripartition of the digestive tract has further progressed. The cardiac sphincter is now fully formed in between the esophagus and the stomach, and the pyloric sphincter in between the stomach and the intestine and the anal sphincter at the level of the anus have also started forming. Around the esophagus, the coelomic pouch has further developed into two bilobed sacs (or pouches), one on each side of the digestive tract. Finally, within the apical pole domain, as well as within the ciliary band, differentiated neurons with their extended axons can also now be distinguished by immunostaining. In parallel, the apical tuft of long and immotile cilia remains discernable at the tip of the oral hood, while in parallel the ciliary band has further started growing a concentrated number of intermediate size motile cilia, which will be used by the larva to swim directionally.

The larva now possesses a completely tripartite and functional digestive tract composed of an esophagus, a stomach, and an intestine, respectively limited by a cardiac sphincter, a pyloric sphincter, and an anal sphincter. Around the esophagus, the right and left coelomic pouches have further started to grow in size and elongate. The first morphological indicator of a left-right asymmetry becomes apparent at that stage, the left coelomic pouch being slightly more elongated than the right one. Furthermore, a thin protrusion of non-skeletogenic mesenchyme cells can be seen extending from the left coelomic pouch to the anterior ectoderm. This is the primary pore canal, which opens to the exterior environment by the hydropore. The larva further now possesses, all around the esophagus, a network of contractile muscles allowing it to swallow and feed. Finally, the apical tuft previously observed at the animal pole has by now disappeared, leaving behind only the concentrated stretch of intermediate size cilia borne by the ciliary band.

The larva has indeed extended on the ventral side two additional posterodorsal arms and has developed on the anterior side an additional skeletal element called the dorsal arch. In addition, at the basis of the postoral and posterodorsal arms, four small patches of ciliary band have by now cut off and migrated toward the apex, forming four patches of ciliated structures called the epaulettes (one posterior and one anterior pair). The nervous system of the larva has also become more complex with cell bodies and axons being present all along the arms and for the latter as well throughout the apex. The left and right coelomic pouches have continued to elongate on each side of the digestive tract. As a note this stage is relatively fleeting.

ECAO:0000500	8-arm pluteus larva stage		late feeding larva period				The 8-arm pluteus larva is mainly characterized morphologically by the presence on the ventral side of the larva of eight arms and by the development within the larva, on the left side of the stomach, of the adult rudiment. This stage is relatively long. It includes distinct changes occurring to the larva as well as within the larva, although the larva consistently exhibits 8 arms. In addition, it should be highlighted that the sequence of events taking place at the level of the larva compared to that occurring on the left side of the stomach to form the rudiment are heterochronic, meaning that differences are observed among individuals in the relative timing of these events. From the larval point of view, at that stage, on the anterior side, the dorsal arch has extended out of the oral hood, thereby forming two additional arms above the mouth, i.e. the preoral arms. In parallel, across the apex, the epaulettes have continued developing, thereby generating four large structures rich in cilia and perpendicular to the ventro-dorsal axis. At the tip of the apex, the suture of the body rods has also eventually ruptured, considerably enlarging the larval apex and reducing the angle between the postoral and posterodorsal arms. In parallel, inside the larva, the left coelomic pouch has also by now been partitioned into three parts: the axocoel (upper part, close to the esophagus), the hydrocoel (middle part) and the somatocoel (lower part, next to the stomach). Likewise, on the opposite side, the right coelomic pouch has also been partitioned into a right axohydrocoel and a right somatocoel, although the right axohydrocoel remains in a rudimentary state compared to its left counterparts. In addition, at the basis of the posterodorsal arm on the left side, a small portion of the ectoderm has thickened, invaginated, and came into contact with the left hydocoel. This structure is called the vestibule and together with the left hydrocoel and the left stomatocoel they have further subsequently fused to form the adult rudiment. The formation of the rudiment has overall taken some time, giving rise first to a pentaradial disc and then to a pentaradial complex structure harboring podia (i.e. tube feet) and spines. In parallel, on the right size of the larva, a variable number of pedicellariae (one to four) and endoskeletal elements (i.e. the five genital plates) have further formed, which will also later contribute to the composition of the adult body.

The rudiment further harbors by now five long primary podia (i.e. tube feet), five quartets of definitive spines located between the primary podia and five pairs of immature spines at the basis of the primary podia, while on the opposite side, i.e. on the right side of the larva, five to seven immature spines have further developed, supported by the genital plates, along with one to four pedicaellariae. At the level of the larva, in parallel, the anterior and posterior pairs of epaulettes have also considerably increased in size by now and even fused dorsally to the hydropore and to the anus respectively, thereby leaving exempt of cilia two lateral fields in between them. At the center of the left lateral field, the vestibular roof has also by now ruptured and this opening has created the vestibular pore, through which some primary podia of the rudiment protrude outside the larva and scrutinize the substrate looking for the adequate cues to begin metamorphosis. At that stage, the larva is thus exhibiting a typical substrate-test behavior, going to the sea bottom and scrutinizing the substrate. This behavior is characteristic of a larva named competent to metamorphosis, which it will accomplish providing that it is adequately stimulated by environmental factors. 	cPlut, Cpt8a	UBERON_0008265												Formery et al., (in prep)  Gosselin, P. and Jangoux, M.

ECAO:0000520	metamorphic larva stage		late feeding larva period				The metamorphic larva stage consists essentially of the evagination of the echinoid rudiment. It is characterized by the execution of conspicuous and relatively abrupt physical changes that take place quite quickly, in about one hour, and during which the planktonic larva is transformed into a benthic juvenile. At that stage, the larva is settled on the substrate and is firmly attached to it by the primary podia of the rudiment. The ectodermal epithelium of its arms has started to collapse, making the spicules supporting the larval arms piercing through the epidermis. The larval mouth and anus have further closed, while in parallel, within the larva, the rudiment spines have lifted up thereby distending the vestibular wall and wide opening the vestibular pore. Following these movements, the rudiment has farther down accomplished and finalized its complete eversion, encapsulating the digestive tract and reaching the right side of the larval body. During this process, the genital plates and the associated pedicellariae and immature spines present on the right side of the larva have further completed the production of the aboral part of the adult body. At the end of metamorphosis, hence at the end of the metamorphic larva stage, the individual has thus become benthic, it is settled in the substrate, and it looks like an adult pentaradial sea urchin although it is smaller in size, deprived of a functional digestive system and sexually immature. 	metamorphosis, meta													Formery et al., (in prep)  Gosselin, P. and Jangoux, M.

Like the adult, it displays a pentarial symmetry and is settled on the substrate. An early juvenile is about 300 µm in diameter. On its aboral side, it still exhibits some remaining larval rods and tissues, although these will soon disappear. In addition, the plates forming its endoskeleton are still rather light and porous making it looking relatively clear, although it bears lots of red-pigmented cells. However, the postlarva is still deprived of a mouth and an anus, hence of a functional digestive tract. The early juvenile is thus endotrophic, meaning that its growth and development solely relies on energy derived from internal sources. Furthermore, the early juvenile is sexually immature.

ECAO:0000560	late juvenile stage		juvenile period				The late juvenile really looks like a small adult. The plates of its endoskeleton have by now densified providing it with a dark shell. In addition, it has finally developed a functional digestive tract. The digestive tract inherited from the larva has indeed by now undergone a complete reorganization, progressively bending within the perivisceral cavity to form two successive loops. The buccal plates and the aristotle lantern have further finished developing, creating a new mouth that has opened on the oral side at the center of the aristotle's lantern, while a new anus has also opened in the periproct, i.e. at the center of the five genital plates. The late juvenile can thus feed and starts growing in size, by grazing on the substrate. The late juvenile is exotrophic, meaning that its growth and development rely on energy derived from external sources. In addition, the primary podia have started to regress by that stage and will eventually disappear, while secondary podia have emerged and are functional, allowing the juvenile to move. Similarly, the immature spines have also started to be lost and be replaced by definitive spines. The genital plate CD has further differentiated into the madreporite and sphaeridia have formed. However, this individual is still sexually immature.	ExJuv	UBERON_0007021												Formery et al., (in prep)  Gosselin, P. and Jangoux, M. (1998).

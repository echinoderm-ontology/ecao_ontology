ECAO:0000240	blastula period		embryogenesis phase				The period that immediately follows cleavage and precedes gastrulation. It is characterized by the progressive maturation of the embryo into a hollow sphere, which is one cell layer thick and encompasses a central, fluid-filled cavity (the blastocoel). This period is associated with a gradual increase in cell cycle length and a loss of mitotic synchrony. During mitosis, cells round up and the wall of the blastula becomes irregular, while during interphase the cells flatten and the wall of the blastula appears smooth. During this period, the blastocoel gradually expands and becomes lined by a thin basal lamina. Cells in the wall of the blastula thereby become polarized; the inner (basal) surface of each cell contacts the basal lamina while the outer (apical) surface contacts the hyaline layer, an extracellular matrix that surrounds the embryo. Each cell further forms a single apical cilium. The onset of ciliary motility causes the blastula to move within the fertilization envelope and, after hatching, coordinated ciliary beating allows the embryo to swim freely. The blastula period culminates in the formation of the vegetal plate, a placode of elongated, presumptive endomesoderm cells.

ECAO:0000430	prism stage		organogenesis period				The embryo is mainly characterized morphologically by a typical triangular shape, the beginning of the tripatition of the digestive tract and the presence of pigmented cells. The oral (or ventral) ectoderm has by now even more flattened, making an almost perfect right angle with the blastoporal side of the embryo. By contrast, on the opposite side, the aboral (or dorsal) ectoderm has round up and slightly elongated, thereby forming the primitive apex of the future larvae. These changes have conferred the embryo a typical and easy recognizable triangular shape. In the oral ectoderm, a small depression has further appeared, called the stomodeum, which will later fuse with the tip of the archenteron to form the mouth. In the blastocoel, the digestive tract has also by now bended toward the stomodeum and started to become tripartite. The cardiac sphincter has started forming, separating the future esophagus from the future stomach. The triradiate spicules have also continued elongating, thereby forming by now, towards the animal pole, the right and left dorsoventral connecting rods, towards the apex, the body rods, and along the vegetal, oral ectoderm the left and right ventral transverse rods. Moreover, some non-skeletogenic mesenchyme cells (or NSM cells, secondary mesenchyme cells or SMC) have started becoming pigmented and inserted into the aboral ectoderm. These cells represent part of the future immune system of the larvae along with other blastocoelar cells that are present in the blastocoel around the gut. In the vicinity of the future esophagus, other non-skeletogenic mesoderm descendant cells along with some endoderm cells have further arranged to form a single unpaired coelomic pouch. At the animal pole, the apical pole domain has also started to flatten making the embryo look like a square when viewed from the oral side, and it still arbors a tuft a long and immotile cilia. Finally, within the apical pole domain, but not yet in the ciliary band, molecular labeling surveys also start by this stage to reveal the presence of differentiating neuronal cells.

ECAO:0000460	early pluteus larva stage		early feeding larva period				The embryo is by now a fully formed pluteus larva. The mouth has opened and the digestive tract is becoming functional. On the ventral side, the mouth is surrounded anteriorly by an oral hood and posteriorly by two postoral arms. On the dorsal side, the apex has lengthened. The skeleton has indeed continued extending, expending the dorsoventral connecting rods, the body rods, and the ventral transverse rods as well as developing the anterolateral rods and the postoral rods. Within the larva, the tripartition of the digestive tract has further progressed. The cardiac sphincter is now fully formed in between the esophagus and the stomach, and the pyloric sphincter in between the stomach and the intestine and the anal sphincter at the level of the anus have also started forming. Around the esophagus, the coelomic pouch has further developed into two bilobed sacs (or pouches), one on each side of the digestive tract. Finally, within the apical pole domain, as well as within the ciliary band, differentiated neurons with their extended axons can also now be distinguished by immunostaining. In parallel, the apical tuft of long and immotile cilia remains discernable at the tip of the oral hood, while in parallel the ciliary band has further started growing a concentrated number of intermediate size motile cilia, which will be used by the larva to swim directionally.

ECAO:0000590	very late blastula stage		stage 8				The embryo is composed of about 800 cells and is surrounded by a fertilization envelope. The wall of the embryo is thinner and smoother than at previous stages. The vegetal plate has not formed. Many cells are ciliated but the embryo has not begun to rotate within the fertilization envelope. Note for euechinoid indirect developers: molecular labeling typically indicates the presence of 32 large micromere descendants and 4 small micromere descendants at this stage.	vLB												NCBITaxon:7668			15:00:00	late swimming blastula stage	ecao_developmental_stage				
ECAO:0000600	vegetal plate stage		stage 11				The embryo now displays a vegetal epithelial placode, the vegetal plate, that formed at the vegetal pole and thereby provides the first morphological indication of the animal-vegetal axis of the blastula. All cells have developed an apical cilium, although the embryo may or may not have hatched from the fertilization envelope.	VP												NCBITaxon:7668			18:00:00	late blastula stage	ecao_developmental_stage				
ECAO:0000610	open mouth stage		stage 19				This stage is characterized by the opening of the mouth. The right and left coelomic pouches are prominent and well-separated from the foregut by narrow coelomic constrictions. Pronounced cardiac and developing pyloric constrictions (separating respectively the foregut and midgut, and the midgut and hindgut) are visible; the gut is thus visibly tripartite. The developing stomach (former midgut) is enlarged relative to the other segments of the gut and muscle bands surrounding the esophagus are apparent. The ciliary band(s) is (are) also discernable.	2-arm stage, early pluteus stage																late gastrula stage	ecao_developmental_stage				
ECAO:0000620	early prism stage		stage 16				The embryo has a distinctive, angular shape due to the elongation of the skeletal rods. The body rods have elongated toward the apex (posterior end) of the embryo. The dorsoventral connecting rods are elongated, and the postoral rods are still very short although they already support thickened regions of ectoderm that will later form the distal tip of the postoral arms. The archenteron tip is slightly expanded, and its oral surface is directed toward the oral ectoderm. Ingression of secondary mesenchyme cells (SMCs) is complete. The embryo is reddish in color due to the presence of pigment cells within the aboral ectoderm. The animal pole domain (or apical plate) is prominent and the lateral walls of the embryo have thinned. The coelomic pouches and gut constrictions have not yet appeared.																	late gastrula stage	ecao_developmental_stage				
ECAO:0000630	late prism stage		stage 17				The embryo has a distinctive, angular shape due to the elongation of the skeletal rods. The body rods have expended even further compared to earlier stages and the postoral rods support short postoral arm buds. The anterior ends of the dorsoventral connecting rods are also now branched or bent. The archenteron tip is still bent toward the oral ectoderm. At the tip of the archenteron coelomic evaginations start to be apparent, although no gut constrictions are visible yet. The embryo is reddish in color due to the presence of pigment cells within the aboral ectoderm. The animal pole domain is prominent, and it still bears long, immotile cilia. 																	late gastrula stage	ecao_developmental_stage

ECAO:0000650	early organogenesis stage		stage 16				The embryo is elongated along the animal-vegetal axis and has thus a characteristic oblong shape. The archenteron is fully extended, even though it still does not reach the blastocoel roof. The tip of the archenteron is enlarged, rounded, and smooth, and the archenteron has begun to deflect orally. Mesenchyme cell ingression is complete. However, paired coelomic pouches and gut constrictions have not yet formed.																	late gastrula stage	ecao_developmental_stage				
ECAO:0000660	mid-organogenesis stage		stage 17				The embryo is elongated along the animal-vegetal axis and has thus a characteristic oblong shape. The archenteron is overall deflected orally and its tip is enlarged, rounded, and smooth. The tip of the archenteron is further starting to display filopodia that interact with the ectoderm site where the mouth will form. At the tip of the archenteron, unpaired evaginations of the coelom are also now apparent, even though the stomodeal invagination, gut constrictions, and ciliary band(s) are still not discernable. Mesenchyme cells have dispersed through the blastocoel. 																	early organogenesis stage	ecao_developmental_stage				
ECAO:0000670	late organogenesis stage		stage 18				The embryo is characterized by the presence, at the tip of the archenteron, of two well-formed coelomic pouches, separated from the foregut by pronounced constrictions. The cardiac constriction, which separates the foregut and the midgut, has started to form. On the oral side of the embryo, the stomodeal invagination is visible, although the mouth has not yet opened. The ciliary band(s) is (are) not yet visible.																	mid-organogenesis stage	ecao_developmental_stage				
ECAO:0000680	very late organogenesis stage		stage 18				The embryo displays prominent right and left anterior coelomic pouches, and the posterior enterocoel has enlarged. Pronounced cardiac and developing pyloric constrictions (separating respectively the foregut and midgut, and the midgut and hindgut) are formed, and the gut is thus visibly tripartite, with the posterior enterocoel projecting from the developing stomach (former midgut). The wall of the left anterior coelom is distended at both its anterior and posterior margins, where strands of cells extend to the ectoderm. Muscle bands surrounding the esophagus are apparent. Ridges of thickened ectoderm mark the positions of the future ciliary bands.																	late organogenesis stage	ecao_developmental_stage

ECAO:0000700	motile blastula stage		stage 9				The embryo is composed of 400-500 cells and is no longer surrounded by a fertilization envelope. Most cells have completed at least one additional mitotic division after the early blastula stage and the cell divisions are now less synchronous than at earlier stages. The embryo remains spherical in shape and one cell layer thick. It does not display any morphological indications of the embryonic axes or of the vegetal plate. The cells have started to flatten on their inner (basal) surface, further contributing to the enlargement of the blastocoel, which has expanded since the early blastula stage.
